## Comparing Systems

A great deal of comparative education research has focused on systems of education. Sometimes, however, this focus has been implicit rather than explicit. Units of analysis have not always been clearly defined.

This chapter begins by citing some prominent examples which scholars have focused on, relating to systems of education. It then discusses methodological issues, units of analysis in comparative research, notes that some countries have multiple systems of education, and thus that focusing on systems can be intranational as well as cross-national.

Familiar Approaches but Loose Usages

The focus on systems has a long history in the field of comparative education. For example, the title of Sadler's (1900) oft-cited work 'How far can we learn anything of practical value from the study of foreign systems of education?' Kandel (1933, pp.83-206) focused on the organization of national systems of education. Craner and (1956) was entitled 'Contemporary Education: A Comparative Study of National Systems,' and the following decade brought Moehlman's (1963) book entitled Comparative Educational Systems.

This focus has been maintained during subsequent decades. Books appearing during the 1980s included Ignas and Corsini's (1981) 'Comparative Educational Systems' and the set of three volumes co-edited by Cameron et al. (1983) entitled 'International Handbook of Education Systems.' These were followed by the Encyclopedia of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education, which was edited by Postlethwaite and appeared in the first.

Variations also exist within the sub svstems. One major Clemcni tte' years both in Shanghai ndl other cities. The Education Systems of HongKong

Hong Kong is very SIall compared with mainland China. It has population of only ccven Inillion; and land area of just 1,071 square kilometres. The island of HongKong became British colony in [842, and the territory was subsequently enlarged by addition of sections of the mainland and sovereignty Special Administralive Region China. However, Hong Kong retains Muc ulonomv and legal system; und with loca| control over education.

Further variation exists in provision for China' ltli minoritv tionalities. Hong Kong does have rral periphery, but is basically an urban s0 productive fOcus for internal comparative education.

National 106 million; 8.4 per CCn of the total. As in mainland China single territory-wide education. However, within thesstem system there.

Diversily has also been brought by the proliferation of privale schools. In 2002 private primary schools enrolled g million pupils representing numbers 0f schools in 1993/94. Private schools were operated directly by the government; though the 77.1 per cent in the aided sec.
